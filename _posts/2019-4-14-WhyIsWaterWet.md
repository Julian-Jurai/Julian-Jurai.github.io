title: Why is water wet?
---

Have you ever noticed that you can't feel wetness if you hold your hand perfectly stillwhile it is submerged, or that a drop of water on the skin doesn't feel wet? Though it seems simple, feeling that something is wet is quite a feat because our skin does not have receptors that sense wetness

I'm honestly not sure...

This is just some filler text again...
