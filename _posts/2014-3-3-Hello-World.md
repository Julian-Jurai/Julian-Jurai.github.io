title: Lets see whats this AI thing is about
---

One of the paradoxes of today's internet platforms is they are vastly automated, and have no human control or interaction over what any given person sees, and yet they are also totally dependent on human behavior, because what they’re really doing is observing, extracting and inferring things from what hundreds of millions or billions of people do.

The genesis of this was PageRank. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules to understand what each page might be about, or indexing the raw text, PageRank looks at what people have done or have said about that page. Who linked to it, what text did they use, and who linked to the people who linked to it? And at the other end of the pipe, Google gets every user to curate every set of search results by hand: it gives you 10 blue links and you tell Google which one was right. The same thing for Facebook: Facebook doesn't know really know who you are, or what you're interested in, or what that piece of content is. It knows who you follow, what you press ‘like’ on, who else liked that and what else they liked and followed. Facebook is PageRank for people. The same applies, by extension, to YouTube: it never knew what the video was, only what people typed next to it and what else they watched and liked.

In effect, these systems are vast mechanical Turks. They don't know what anything is of itself - rather, they try to create, capture and channel human annotation around those things. They’re vast distributed computing systems in which the CPUs are people and the platform is the router and the interconnections. (This reminds me a little of the idea in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy that the whole Earth is actually a vast purpose-built computer and our daily lives are part of the calculations.)
