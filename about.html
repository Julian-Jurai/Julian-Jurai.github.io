    <h2>A little more about me</h2>
    <span>
      I'm a software engineer at ezCater where I crank out features, review PRs,
      mentor junior engineers and work with cross functional teams to solve our
      business problems.
      <br />
      <br />
      I Studied B.Sc. Mechanical Engineering (Hons.) and worked in a variety of
      different environments. At my last non-software-engineering job I
      constantly found ways to improve the efficiency of my workspace by
      utilizing software to automate tasks. This is where my passion for coding
      began and decided swithed careers.
      <br />
      <br />
      I currently live in Boston MA but I grew up on the island for Trinidad &
      Tobago.
      <br />
      <br />
      I enjoy the beach, climbing trees, fishing and talking to animals (they
      don't talk back unfortunately). 😸 🌴 🏖 🎣 💻
